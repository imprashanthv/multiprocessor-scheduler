# Console Based Multiprocessor Scheduler using Event Driven Algorithm, with C++:
*	Built a console based virtual multiprocessor scheduler with C++ 11 that schedules incoming jobs to the CPU (and its multiple cores).
*	Created the application completely in an Object-Oriented Approach with focus on objects and their interactions with other objects.
*	Created the scheduler that can accept both recurring and non-recurring PCBs using multi-level hierarchy.
*	Implemented timing wheel event driven algorithm to scale up the application to schedule any number of jobs to any number of processors.
*	Implemented Facade, Singleton, and Bridge design patterns.
